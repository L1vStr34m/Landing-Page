# The Odin Project: Responsive Landing Page

This project is a responsive landing page built as part of The Odin Project curriculum. It demonstrates modern web development best practices, including semantic HTML5 structure, CSS custom properties (variables), and responsive design techniques to support all device sizes from mobile to desktop.

---

## Overview

The landing page features:

- **Header with fixed navigation** linking to page sections.
- **Hero section** highlighting the Milky Way galaxy, with an image and descriptive text.
- **Information section** displaying multiple figures with images and captions about space phenomena.
- **Inspirational quote section** featuring a famous Carl Sagan quote.
- **Action section** with a button to demonstrate interactivity potential.
- **Footer** with author credits and links.

The page is designed to adapt smoothly to various screen sizes and provide an accessible, visually appealing user experience.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5:** Semantic structure with `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<figure>`, `<figcaption>`, `<footer>`, and more.
- **CSS3:** Employed CSS custom properties (variables) for color themes and responsive media queries for adaptable layouts.
- **Fonts:** The primary font used is [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto), a modern, clean sans-serif typeface.
- **Colors:** The design uses a well-coordinated palette of background, text, and accent colors defined as CSS variables for easy theme management:
  - Base background: `#F9FAF8`
  - Base text: `#1F2937`
  - Accent color: `#3882F6`
  - Dark background/text variants for contrast and readability in the hero and footer areas.

## Key Features and Design Details

- **Responsive Flexbox Layout:** Sections and content adjust flexibly between rows and columns depending on viewport size.
- **Fixed header:** Navigation remains visible at the top with a subtle shadow.
- **Accessible design:** Proper use of semantic tags and descriptive `alt` attributes for images.
- **Smooth scrolling** to anchor links.
- **Interactive button:** Styled with hover and focus states (though non-functional in this project).
- **Image styling:** Rounded corners and borders complement the page aesthetics.
